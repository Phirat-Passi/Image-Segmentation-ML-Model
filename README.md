# U2Net Image Segmentation ML Model

One of the most important operations in Computer Vision is Segmentation. Image segmentation is the task of clustering parts of an image together that belong to the same object class. This process is also called pixel-level classification. Here, it involves partitioning images (or video frames) into multiple complex segments or objects in order to produce optimum augmented images utilizing the U2Net and Rembg Image Proceesing Models with OpenVINO toolkit.

# Tasks 

Foreground-background separation is a image segmentation task, where the goal is to split the image into foreground and background. In semi-interactive settings, the user marks some pixels as “foreground”, a few others as “background”, and it’s up to the algorithm to classify the rest of the pixels.


    1. Remove the background of an images uploaded
    2. Improve the resolution of the image
    3. Superimpose the product with the backgrounds provided
